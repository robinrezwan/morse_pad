## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a very simple system of communication where text characters are encoded as
standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes.

## Who invented Morse Code?

Morse code was invented by Samuel F. B. Morse in the 1830s. In his earliest design for a code, Morse
had planned to transmit only numbers, and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the
number which had been sent. However, the code was soon improved by Morse's assistant Alfred Lewis
Vail in the 1840s to include letters and special characters, so it could be used more generally.

## Where is Morse Code used?

Morse code was widely used in early telegraph systems, where Morse code signals were sent through
lines and cables. It was also a popular mode of communication in the early days of radio
transmissions before voice transmission became possible. Although more modern techniques of
communication have mostly superseded it, it is still used in some fields such as aviation, marine,
amateur radio activities, and emergency signaling.

## What are the advantages of Morse Code?

Morse code can be used in any form perceivable by the human senses, such as sound, light, touch,
gesture, eye blinking, and so on. It merely requires the timed presence or absence of these things,
and anyone who understands Morse code can interpret it immediately. Morse code can also be utilized
with many information-carrying mediums including electric current, radio waves, etc.

## How is Morse Code formed?

Morse Code encodes letters, numbers, some punctuations, and procedural signals to a sequence of dots
and dashes. There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters in Morse code. The dot
duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is
three times the duration of a dot, which means three units. The dots and dashes in an encoded
character are separated by a signal absence, called a space, which has a duration of one unit time.
The letters of a word are separated by a space of three units of time, and words are separated by a
space of seven units of time.
